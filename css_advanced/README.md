CSS Advanced:
Project Description
This project marks the transition from pure HTML structuring to comprehensive CSS styling. Building upon a pre-defined semantic HTML foundation, the primary objective is to meticulously style a webpage according to a provided designer file (Figma). This involves applying advanced CSS techniques to achieve a pixel-perfect and responsive design, bringing the static HTML structure to life.
